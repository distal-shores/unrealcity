Unreal City is Vancouver’s new music festival, celebrating the city’s underground rock music culture for two days of shows from incredible local artists. Expect a mix of punk, indie, shoegaze, metal, post-rock, and post-punk—an unfiltered lineup of artists keeping the spirit of the city's rich DIY culture alive.

Built by artists, for artists, Unreal City is all about community. We’re taking over the Russian Hall in Vancouver’s historic Strathcona/Raymur/Hogan’s Alley neighbourhood for two days this January (Friday, Jan 10, and Saturday, Jan 11). Upstairs, you’ll find the bands; downstairs, DJs, food, community tables, and more.

Check out the <a href="/bands">Bands</a> page for more info on 2025’s stacked lineup, or hit up the <a href="/faq">FAQ</a> for answers to your burning questions.

Come through and be a part of Unreal City’s first year: snow, rain, or shine.
