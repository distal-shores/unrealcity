Mental Healthâ€™s moniker could be a call to action, an ideal to aspire to,  or simply this band of ruffians taking the piss. So goes their music, bobbing and weaving around the expectations of emo and garage: wordy but straight to the point, warm but shot through with unease. Veterans of the Vancouver scene, they mostly elect to take things as they come, but those who know know that this is one of Vancouver most consistently excellent projects.
