Doom/Stoner metal three-piece Burnt Lung comes out of a whirlwind of 2024 performances with a killer self-titled EP. 

“A really awesome mix of metal styles, classic, doom, stoner and some sludge as well. Excellent songs that keep my head banging. Super fuzzy guitars in front of pounding drums…the semi harsh vocals are perfect for the mix. This is not for the faint of heart. BURNT LUNG, more please!!!”
~ S Patrick Brooks (The Heavy Underground Farm Report, Outlaws of the Sun)

Expect plenty of bong riffs and all the "gnarly metallic stoner goodness" that is Burnt Lung. IOW, don't Sleep on 'em.
