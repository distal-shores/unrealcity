Doom/Stoner metal three-piece Burnt Lung comes out of a whirlwind of 2024 performances with a killer self-titled EP. 

“Their blend of heavy riffs and socially conscious lyrics, addressing issues like LGBTQ+ rights and social injustice, creates an intense and provocative sonic experience. The EP reflects both personal struggles and political messages, making it a significant entry into the modern punk scene.” 

– Jason Crews, Infraredmag.com 

Expect plenty of bong riffs and all the "gnarly metallic stoner goodness" that is Burnt Lung. IOW, don't Sleep on 'em.
