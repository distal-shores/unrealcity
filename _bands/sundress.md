This is going to be one of the heaviest sets at UC. Sundress only started inspiring mosh pits in earnest in 2025 and have been completely relentless in their campaign to hit every venue in Van more than once, while yet to drop a single non-live recording. This is your chance to get in the fandom nice and early. 

They might gaze at their shoes while cranking out an urgent strumming pattern or tender interlude, but a noise attack, call for freedom, pounding d-beat, or overall expression of female-fronted defiance is coming on like an atmospheric river when you’re wearing your summer Sunday best. Don’t bother bringing a change of clothes, just strap on your Docs and enjoy the deluge.
