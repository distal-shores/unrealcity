Looking at Conduit's band photo you might not know what to expect: three genial-seeming friends yukking it up, these guys could make any kinda music. Well, they happen to make metallic, bracing punk that swims in the murky waters of the early eighties, when hardcore and post-punk seemed not-so-eager to define themselves (or be defined).

As an outfit, Conduit have been in no particular hurry to put out recorded music, but that's okay, because everything they have released is intentional, authentic, high-quality. Live, these unassuming guys are all experienced performers, ripping off brief but potent songs while bantering with the crowd comfortably: not pandering to the old heads, nor worried about what the kids think.
