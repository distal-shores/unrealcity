Michael Brown a.k.a. Michael Slumber makes ethereal, elegiac dark folk that shakes the bones and stirs the soul. A versatile performer (catch him also supporting <a href="/bands/jody-glenham">Jody Glenham</a>) and one of the most underrated guitarists in the city, Brown's project has seen many different arrangement configurations over the years. Always playfully riffing on his deep catalogue of songs to give audiences a morphing and authentic take on his quixotic music, catch Michael Slumber summoning spirits on our stripped-down downstairs stage with his bandmates.
