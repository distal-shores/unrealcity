la lune make beautiful, swirling, heavy as fuck shoegaze that prioritizes elegant, memorable songwriting over amplifier worship and boutique pedal zaniness (though you needn't worry, there's plenty of that too.) Ethan Rebalkin and OIivia Wells' interlocking vocal melodies are the beating heart of the songs featured on their 2024 debut EP <span style="font-style:italic">disparity</span>, and the new material they've been performing live this past year continues the trend while ratcheting up the tempestuous guitar theatrics. Crushing and gliding all at once, la lune's Unreal City set is one you won't want to miss.
