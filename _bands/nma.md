Tom Levitt (NMA) builds verb-drenched edifices haunted by end-of-the-hall vocals, where shoegaze meets slowcore in a delicate push-and-pull. His music invites you closer, offering glimpses of vulnerability that might leave you unsettled yet unable to turn away.

Long cherished locally for their propulsive live sets, NMA have set the table for a 2025 release with recent single <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6igrzszn2ZVKGqsXYQAhBS?si=11ce7263928a4b7b">"Y U Wanna"</a>.
