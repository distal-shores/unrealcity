Since the global punk movement started in the 1970s, how many bands have called Vancouver home? 10,000? 50,000? More? The number doesn’t matter; what does is that vanishingly few of them have achieved the kind of enduring respect and affection from their supporters and peers as By A Thread.

Veterans of every punk-adjacent Vancouver scene of the last 30 years, these legends surprised nearly everyone by dropping their third full-length in October. That new album, <span style="font-style:italic">Mirrored Life</span>, isn’t some exercise in nostalgic assembly: it’s a propulsive journey through various stages of grief and self-reflection (hence the title), at times mediative but mostly flat-out confrontational in its demonstration of the cathartic potential of heavy, melodic punk.

“I’ve been to 25 By A Thread shows, maybe more,” someone told me at their October 10th release show at Red Gate. “I’ve never seen them slip. I love this band.” Us too, friend.
