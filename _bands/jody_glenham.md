For many years, Jody Glenham has been documenting the rhythms of often challenging, ultimately rewarding daily life in Vancouver in her rich and unforced tessitura. Friend (and in her dayjob as bartender, often confidante) to seemingly every musician, sound person, journalist and scene head in the city, a Jody Glenham record can often feel like a birdwatcher's guide to the many chirps and plumages of Vancouver's music scene fauna. 

Musically, the many timbres and arrangement choices of her compositions match this multifaceted subject matter, with regular bandmates Mike Brown and Adam Fink nimbly working out the nuanced-but-palatable parts and giving Jody's vocal, keys and guitar work ample room to breathe. 

Jody graces our Saturday, January 17 stage at Russian Hall with a set as smooth and intoxicating as a finely crafted cocktail.
