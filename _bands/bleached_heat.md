Welsh born and recently residing in Vancouver, Stevie a.k.a. Bleached Heat makes infectiously moveable body music in the vein of Boy Harsher or Lowlife. A Bleached Heat set is sure to feature a dizzying array of instrumentation being deployed by one person in a dark dance floor quest to make you put on your best black band shirt and shake your damn ass.
