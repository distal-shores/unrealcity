Sometimes ballady, early Nirvana-y, singalongaly Santana latin-y, Grinch Simpson always gives you something to dance to and doesn’t bother being demure. The Grinch (Cam) himself and regular collaborator Marie Catafesta regularly assemble coteries of local luminaries to jam with on the latest single (“Never Want to Feel This Way Again”, October 10 2025) and the current lineup is nothing to shake a green-painted monorail at. 

Don’t miss them downstairs at Russian Hall on Saturday afternoon. If you ask nicely they might even wear their astronaut suits.
