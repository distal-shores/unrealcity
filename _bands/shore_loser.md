Shore Loser sit comfortably at the intersection of scrappy indie rock and melody-driven singer-songwriting, writing songs that feel as lived-in as an old ball cap. Chris Johnson’s direct lyricism taps into the pains of existence without being overwrought, the understated appeal to sincerity nodding to the complexity of being one will glean from  late night sessions with Tracy Chapman or Elliott Smith records.
