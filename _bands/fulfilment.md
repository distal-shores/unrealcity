Some people sew a Misfits patch on their jacket and call themselves punk, but Calgary's Fulfilment do not mess around with any of that. They've been around long enough to know better, and more importantly, they've been doing things the right (read: hard) way that entire time.

Front man and multidisciplinary artist Kevin Stebner is one of those completely at-ease bandleaders who seems like he was born with a guitar in his hands and a mic in front of his face, while Steven Duggins and David Tkach form one of the most underappreciated rhythm sections in Western Canada. Together they execute a buzzsaw half-hour of no-bullshit, hardcore-inflected punk.

2025 saw the band release <i>Husky House</i>, a perfectly rendered 10-song missile exploring the personal outfall of being in the crosshairs of class warefare, that earned praise from Exclaim!, among many other outlets. As Unreal City's only Alberta entry, Fulfilment are not one to gap on at UC26.
