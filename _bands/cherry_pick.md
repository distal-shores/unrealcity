Local shoegazer Cherry Pick, fresh off the success of their full-band single "Doe-Eyed" and a previous 4-track EP <span style="font-style:italic">Sorry Place</span>, recently spoke with JPThemusicEnjoyer. In the interview, Cherry shared: “Honest to god, when I’m making a song, I’m making it for my high school self. The only thing I hope someone gains from my music is a song to be lowkey emo to while walking down the halls. Also, queer shoegaze fans don’t have many WLW songs.”
