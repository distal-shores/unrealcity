At first blush, Ira Hardly seems like a project that would more likely spring from New York or Montreal, cities with long histories of producing stylish Bohemian songsmiths projecting world-weary, wry humour. But lean in a little closer and you’ll realize that the band’s particular brand of world-weariness is very Vancouver: not hurried, not status-obsessed, and very skeptical of moving to the country (literally a song title on his latest, Hardly Ira.)

Songwriter Ira Hardy’s funniest-guy-at-the-party antics could easily translate to one guy and a beat up Taylor holdin’ down the 3x5’ stage at the local open mic, but he takes the high road toward a rippin’ four-piece live band instead. These guys are gonna make you chuckle, sure, but they’re also gonna make you shake a leg, and that’s important: conviction only comes from ambition, and these songs aim to convince.
