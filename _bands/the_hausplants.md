Is the power trio the truest representation of the rock band? The Hausplants make the case that it is. A triforce of prowess and energy on stage, each member’s individual contributions can be heard and felt at nearly all times equally, a sonic plurality that informs every aspect of how the band projects itself.

It’s no surprise then that 2025’s EP was titled “Into Equilibrium,” although this writer remains skeptical they were ever out of it. Anna Zeleny’s vocals flit across a skyscape of Amir Alav’s jazz-inflected pickin’ and strummin’, featherweight and dreamlike enough to float away if not drilled into the ground by Sondor Mendbayar’s rocksteady drumming.

The Hausplants seem like a band that has never had a bad time together in the rehearsal room. For some bands that would seem like complacency—for this band it speaks to the strength of a unified vision.
