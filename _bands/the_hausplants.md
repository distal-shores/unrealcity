The Hausplants are an indie post-punk band from the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm, Sḵwx̱wú7mesh, səlilwətaʔɬ (Vancouver) Canada. Hailing from Iran, Mongolia, and Minnesota, USA, their sound is a synthesis of their diverse backgrounds in music and life. Forming in 2022, the band came together to create music that is liberated, energetic, and experimental. They have played numerous shows in their adopted city over the last two years. They are currently recording a second EP (following 2023's Bright, Indirect Light), scheduled for release in February 2025."
