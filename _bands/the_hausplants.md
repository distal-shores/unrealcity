The Hausplants make electrifying indie rock in Vancouver by way of Iran, Mongolia, and Minnesota, weaving diverse musical and cultural influences into a sound that's both bold, bright and boundary-pushing. Since their formation in 2022, The Hausplants have been a fixture on diverse bills around the city with their experimental style, becoming a standout act in their adopted city. Following the success of their 2023 debut EP, Bright, Indirect Light, the band is gearing up to release their highly anticipated follow-up in February 2025.
