Like sped up vaporwave but less ironic, Patrick Farrugia’s solo pop album came out December 2025 with an aesthetic as finely coiffed as their moustache. Ukulele, violin, and the occasional wave of shoegaze distortion or dream synth bring big range, not to mention the production skills and options Patrick pulls out of the toolbox like instruments of their own. 

Of course there’s plenty of hooky riffs they keep coming up with despite lending prodigious talents playing Fenders (and maybe a Guild) in Buddie. Patrick blesses the Unreal Citizenry with sets from both barrels and performs solo Saturday night.
