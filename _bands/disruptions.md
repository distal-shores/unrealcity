For most of us, there’s probably been a moment in the last two years where we wanted to throw a Molotov cocktail through the window of a parked Cybertruck—that dull gunmetal edifice to Silicon Valley greed and myopia, easy target, just begging to be defaced. It’s unclear if Disruptions actually did this or not, but at least the sentiment showed up pictorially on the cover of their recent single release, “CYBERFUCK.” Importantly, the music matches what’s on the tin.

A Disruptions song starts the way a Mixed Martial Arts match does: lunging, looking for something to exploit, not letting up once it has you on the mat. There’s an economy to how the band deploys its brutality, never wasting a distorted squeal or a plaintive wail, everything in service to the cause of making you feel something. And if you end up on that mat, well, best to just surrender.
