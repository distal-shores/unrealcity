For a band whose chosen genre espouses staring at one’s own footwear, there’s something contradictorily confident about shoe gazers Bloom Effect. Anyone who’s had the pleasure of seeing Jula Lafit effortlessly hold down a crowd knows that the band are prepared for their moment—and the moment seems to be coming, with each higher-profile opening slot (Zoon, Ladytron) following the release of their latest EP “oscilón” in September.

Bloom Effect shows live in the body as much as the ears, the band summoning a truly impressive current swell of sound and energy out of an expertly deployed combination of instruments and effects. Despite—or perhaps because of—the racket, Tom Rappa’s drumming never gets overwhelmed, a sturdy house to trap the overlapping waves generated by Lafit and guitarist Craig Weighman.
