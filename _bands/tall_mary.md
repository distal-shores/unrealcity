Tall Mary makes mystical noise punk in so-called "Vancouver." Their debut double album <span style="font-style:italic">When Will I Find Something New</span> on Kingfisher Bluez, has been described as 

"an incredibly impressive endeavor: we're talking 17 songs, some of them veering up toward the 10-minute mark, all of them infused with a breathtaking intensity and a thematic core centering around Klassen's experience coming out as trans after Covid lockdown."

"Tall Mary blends noise rock, post-punk, and performance art, playing guitars with awls. Their name reflects a personal journey of self-discovery, resonating with themes of gender non-conformity and mysticism."
