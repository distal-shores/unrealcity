Everyone talks about how much they love the incredible wave of female artists who redefined the alternative music scene in the '90s: Alanis, kd, PJ et. al. But when it comes time to put pen to paper, few artists are committed to taking on the daunting task of trying to recapture that energy. 

Hailing from the underrated music scene of the Fraser Valley, Meagan Breanne is one such artist who wants more from her six-string than to cobble a few chords together. Breanne picks around the edges of emotionality, using metaphor to paint in broad strokes while remaining understated enough to be believed.
