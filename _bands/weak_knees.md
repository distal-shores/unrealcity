Airy, jangly riffs, big kicks and punchy drums underscore Weak Knees' upbeat indie tunes on their debut EP <span style="font-style:italic">Dude, You Crying?</span> Katie So's voice glides from slouch to scream and leads a chorus of gang vocals through some intensely relatable millennial feelings. With shows from Sled Island to Toronto, Victoria and York, Ontario in the last two years and a stunner of a video set for STANDARDS, Weak Knees are firming up pretty nice.
