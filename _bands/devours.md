It's safe to say Jeff Cancade a.k.a. Devours is one of one: a homegrown (Nanaimo counts, right?) legend who has pulled himself up fully by his own bootstraps; a genre-bending auteur who writes, performs, records, produces, mixes, and promotes his own material (not just with Devours, but with his excellent ambient project The Golden Age of Wrestling); a tireless advocate of the Vancouver music scene who always celebrates and never apologies for its many, er...idiosyncracies; an icon of our city's queer artists' community. 

It's easy to take all this for granted--it's true that Devours performs around Vancouver a lot, at everything ranging from a mural festival kickoff to opening for big touring acts to headlining little festivals like ours--but Jeff is such a prolific writer and performer, you're unlikely to ever see the same set twice. Not only that, he puts himself into each outing in a way that feels wholly of the moment, a consummate performer who never takes a night off.

Oh, and did we mention that he has Japandroids legend Dave Prowse on live drums, backdropping his kaleidoscopic synth landscapes? What else do you need to know? We can't think of a more representative killer to close out our already deadly lineup.
