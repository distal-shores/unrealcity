If there’s a frontrunner for most likely to inspire a sweaty dance pit at UC, it’s this diverse funk punk five piece. They were probably also the only possible pick to open for Antibalas at The Pearl last month, which is far from faint praise. WACK’s incredibly groovy basslines and latin-inspired drums build a rock-solid base for wah pedal riffs and vocals that rise to impassioned highs and a drawl Mike Muir would be proud to shout. 

Slowdowns, solos and sizzling hi-hats make every WACK song a thrill ride full of push-pull and reasons to move your feet. Better warm up with some light, dynamic stretches so you don’t get thrown out of… wack.
