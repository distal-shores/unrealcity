Dusknote is a collection of musical elixirs, distilled over decades by Canadian multi-instrumentalist Adam Parent.

Adam planted roots early on playing drums with his 2 brothers in critically acclaimed heavy-fusion juggernaut Ninjaspy.  Relentless touring led inevitably to freelance work.  He thrived on writing with artists of many different genres and doing session work with Juno and Grammy award winning producers.

Combining the delicate folk sensibilities ingrained in his youth, the emancipation of an undeniable pocket and the intoxication of psychedelic flavoring,  Dusknote is a true melting pot of sound derived from unbridled musical exploration that is only just getting stirred.
