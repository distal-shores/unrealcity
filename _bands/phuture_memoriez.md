Absurdist tech-rockers Phuture Memoriez evoke Devo and other performative confrontationalists, but even beyond this interesting affect there is a dedication to cohesive, project-level songwriting underpinning their album work. Recently released The Greatest Jockey Of All Time demonstrates the band’s continued development, showcasing offbeat hooks and rhythms that construct a deranged world all their own.

On stage, the three-piece use an array of instrumentation and tools to bring their creations to life, a trio of mad sonic scientists.
