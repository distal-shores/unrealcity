Punk trio Aversions gained attention on Bandcamp's homepage with their last two releases, 2022's Sharp Left Turns and 2023's You Wanted the Bike. On record, their songs combine ambiance, deadpan vocals, and intense riffs, striking a balance between the bleakness of post-punk and the raw energy of post-hardcore. On stage, they channel this powerful mix with a sense of urgency and fierce intensity.
