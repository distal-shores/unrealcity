Punk trio Aversions gained attention on Bandcamp's homepage with their last two releases, 2022's <span style="font-style:italic">Sharp Left Turns</span> and 2023's <span style="font-style:italic">You Wanted the Bike</span>. On record, their songs combine ambiance, deadpan vocals, and intense riffs, striking a balance between the bleakness of post-punk and the raw energy of post-hardcore. On stage, they channel this powerful mix with a sense of urgency and fierce intensity.
