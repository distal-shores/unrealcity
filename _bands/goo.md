In their relatively short time in the scene, Vancouver’s GØØ have endeared themselves to nearly everybody not only with their genuine enthusiasm for all things local (I think we spied them rocking out amongst the 2025 Unreal Citizenry, did we not??) but also for their killer, heavy, original take on melody-driven alternative rock.

There are many bands at this year’s festival that can write a lingering hook, but none better than GØØ, who have the rare talent of writing songs that make you hum along while slam-dancing. Another 3-piece that makes more with less, the addition of Kellan McDonald’s samples to the familiar mix of bass, drums, and guitar helps unlock textural intrigue.

“GØØ Loves You!” is the band’s popular refrain. We think there are some audiences ready to leave a toothbrush behind.
