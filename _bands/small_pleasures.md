“Less is more” is certainly a cliche in rock and punk at this point, but that doesn’t make it less true. Victoria’s Small Pleasures quite literally embody the mantra with their two-person footprint, but economy of conveyance is rooted in their music as well. Bassist/vocalist Viny keeps it in lockstep with sometimes-gloomy, sometimes-chipper basslines reminiscent of The Jesus and Mary Chain’s earthen grooves, while drummer Nevada tenderizes the kit with a showman’s flair, acrobatic fills and strikes that never feel forced.

Mainstays of the West Coast post-punk scene for several years across multiple projects, Small Pleasures find themselves globetrotting between Canadian coasts and in far-flung France and Europe.
