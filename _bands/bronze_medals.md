Instrumental no-wave music can easily veer into clichéd territory (the old chestnut that post-rocks bands are forever soundtracking a movie that no one wants to watch), but there's none of that in Bronze Medals' set. The only thing they're soundtracking is your experience of seeing them tap into each other's best impulses and propel granite-edged, interlocking threads into a trance-like euphoria--or dysphoria, depending what headspace you're in going to the show.

It's easy enough to catch a grove and loop a pattern, but Bronze Medals know that through dedication to the cause, there's a whole other level to unlock. Catch them rocking the main stage, Saturday January 17th at Russian Hall.
