Fans of the reflective, bass-heavy rock music pioneered by bands from Asheville, N.C. or Philadelphia in recent years will find a lot to like in Vancouver’s checkedout.

Non-linear songwriting encourages guitarists/vocalists Clayton Ikuta and Emma Wetherill’s interweaving parts, while Jacob Lamour and Adam Bruce’s rich mesh of bass and drums provides the requisite emotive heft.
