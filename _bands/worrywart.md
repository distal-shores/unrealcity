Hail Mary Baby, worrywart's 2024 debut LP, is a blast of jubilant, noisy, absolutely spellbinding indie rock. Primary songwriter Riley Epp's vocals soar atop in-the-red guitars that warp and distend the rest of the sonic landscape : a wild tumble of electric keyboards, bass and roiling percussion. There's a gravity, or perhaps a weary, hard-earned joy that buoys these ten tracks through unpredictable twists and turns. Straddling the border between punk, folk and experimental music, worrywart are one of Vancouver’s most exciting bands, and their Unreal City set will be an emotional eruption you can’t miss.
