Intricate trumpet and guitar chorus over a staccato rhythm section that won't let you stand still. Superkrystal's Balkan and folk roots are on proud display even as they smear, chop and groove it into a new infectious blend of instrumental tunes. A grant from the Canada Council for the Arts fuelled recording of their first full-length, expected to drop December 2024 just in time to digest before hearing it all live at Unreal City.
