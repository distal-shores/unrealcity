Hillsboro share the precociousness of many of the essential rock bands of the current Victoria/Vancouver zeitgeist, having come up in the very first days of the ‘20s playing a Nirvana cover convincingly and generally seeming like they might have to bat a lash to get served at the bar. But that was five long years ago, and now the band—still full of piss and vinegar, don’t you worry—are certified road dawgs, elder statesmen of many a Green Auto bill showing the next wave how it’s done.

Through all that creative and literal evolution, the violin-toting five-piece have never lost track of their essential conviction: that music is a particular emotion that can only be conveyed through craft. Any Hillsboro set will show you that these are artists who are confident enough to break down; are generous enough to light up; know exactly how and when to let you in and will push you away only far enough to be properly heard.
