Contrast is the heart of grunge, and turning the vocals dial from 90s Seattle to sunny Stanley Park makes it even starker. Buddie’s indie pop hooks set off its big drums and grindy overdrive, rising and then dialing way back again like waves in heavy weather. 

It neatly mirrors a Philly transplant’s wonder at the west coast, right as it hits the reality of scraping by in the present dystopia. Fans of Dead Soft should prepare to be serenaded Saturday night by their best new Buddie and their two month old album, Glass - out now on clear vinyl, natch.
